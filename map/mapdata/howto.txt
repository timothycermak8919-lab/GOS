::INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING MAPS::

create a file called "<map_name>.map" where <map_name> is the name of your map with all spaces replaced with "_". Preserve case in the filename.

in this new file paste the text output by the towneditor in this form:

	<?php
	$mapdata="
	<map data from towneditor>
	";
	?>
	
Then in the file "coordinates.inc" create a line for your map with the form:
array( x , y , max_resource_cost , has_market, has_trading_post, has_bank, has_armory)

use 1's or 0's for the "has" fields and the world map coordinate for the x and y.
